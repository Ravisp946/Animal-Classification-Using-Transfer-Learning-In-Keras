Using transfer Learning To Classify 3 Classes of Animals

In this python notebook I have used Transfer Learning for classification of 3 classes of animals. 
I have used resnet50 model already trained on "Imagenet" Dataset and downloaded it from keras.application.

Same architecture of model is used only the difference is that two fully connnected layers are added at the end of standard resnet50 model 
and a final dense layer is added for the classfication of 3 classes.

I have provide a sample of all 3 classes of animals on this reprository with which you can play around the model.
But you can always download or create your new own dataset and play around the model with that.

Have Fun and use other type of dataset with different number of classes to check the accuracy of model.
